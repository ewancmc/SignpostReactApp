# The Pilgrim’s Guide to the Workplace

("https://i.ibb.co/6vJPmBC/Signpost-React-App-Mockup.png")

This mobile application serves as a companion app for Dr Agustin Chevez's book, "The Pilgrim’s Guide to the Workplace". 

It’s not necessary to read the book to use this app, but you will get much more out of the Signposts, and understand the illustrations better, if you do so.

This book is Open Access and can be downloaded for free. Reading not your thing?  There is also an audiobook version.
